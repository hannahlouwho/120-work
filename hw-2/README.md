<p>1. Like damn did I do everything backwards and then have to go back in and do it the right way all over again. That was probably the most frusterating experience of my life. Baically I was creating files too soon and then the repositories after I had created the files, but not before I had redowloaded Atom and figured all that out. Weird right? Trust me I went back and forth soooo much</p>

<p>2. It honestly took a lot of patients to finally finish the assignmetns and get to this step. My computer deleted Atom for no reson so I had to redowload that, reconnect, link Github, atom, my file folder. Then save in atom, commit to master, adn push those changes:) WOOHOOO!!!</p>

<p>3. As I mentioned above... YESSSS SOOOO many problems. I did not post in the Github board however. I just problem solved for awhile and eventually found out what the missing links were or what I had done wrong. Fixed that then it was all fine.</p>

<p>4.Not neccesarily at the moment. I just had a huge learning curve and need to process for a day. Then I will have questions.</p>

<p>5.I didnt help at all honestly. I havent been to the board. Ill go look at it right after I turn this in!! I am also late to turning this in because of a few things we discussed over email! THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENTS OMG THSNK YOU!!!!</p>
